## 📊 Dashboard Highlights

Created an interactive **Power BI Dashboard** (included in repo) with:

### 📌 Pages

1. **Global Cold Chain Risk Map**  
   - Shows temperature violations, delays, and spoilage by region.

2. **Forecasting Accuracy Dashboard**  
   - Compares pre- and post-model forecast accuracy, buffer optimization, and avoided stockouts.

3. **Monthly Vaccine Distribution Performance**  
   - Visualizes shipped vs. spoiled units, temperature profiles, and on-time rates.

4. **Technology Impact Simulation**  
   - Highlights estimated savings and risk reduction from AI, blockchain, and smart logistics.

> 💡 *Designed for pharma operations teams and supply chain decision-makers.*
