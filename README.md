# 🧊 Pfizer’s Supply Chain Resilience: Cold Chain & Disruption Solutions

This project is a strategic blueprint for enhancing the resilience of Pfizer’s global pharmaceutical supply chain through advanced technologies and predictive analytics. Conducted as part of Northeastern’s Supply Chain Engineering program, the study addresses major challenges like COVID-19 disruptions, ultra-cold chain logistics, and supplier risk.

## 📌 Core Themes
- ❄️ **Cold Chain Logistics**: Engineered ultra-low temperature transport systems using GPS-enabled thermal containers.
- 📉 **Disruption Forecasting**: Leveraged machine learning for risk detection and real-time decision-making.
- 🧠 **Industry 4.0**: Proposed AI, IoT, and blockchain for global visibility, transparency, and automation.
- 📦 **Inventory Optimization**: Developed buffer stock strategies to offset global supply disruptions.
- 📊 **Financial Impact**: Estimated savings of $10–20M/year in logistics and $30M+ in reduced vaccine waste.

## 📊 Results & Achievements
- ✅ Reduced stockout risk by **20%** using GPS-enabled cold chain infrastructure with real-time temperature monitoring.
- 📈 Improved demand forecasting and buffer planning across **3 global regions** using Excel and Power BI.
